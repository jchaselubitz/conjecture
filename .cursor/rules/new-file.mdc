# Your rule content

### Consider whether it is a component, page, layout, api route, or auth route
- If it is component, organize and name it according to [project-structure.mdc](@project-structure.mdc)
- If it is a page, name should be `page.tsx`
- If it is a layout, name should be `layout.tsx`
- If it is an api route, put it in the `app/api` folder
- If it is an auth route, put it in the `app/auth` folder

### consider whether it is server or client component
 - if it is not clear, refer to [this article](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions)
 - if it is a server component, it should begin with `use server`
 - if it is a client component, it should  begin with `use client`

### Other considerations
- pages should include metadata as defined in [this article](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata)
