# Your rule content

- Buttons that handle async actions should always use the [loading-button.tsx](mdc:components/ui/loading-button.tsx)
- This button requires a buttonState prop. The state for this should appear as ```const [buttonState, setButtonState] useState<ButtonLoadingState>('default')``` 
- When a file contains multiple LoadingButtons, name the states according to the associated operation
